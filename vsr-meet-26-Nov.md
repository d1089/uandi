# VSR Leaders - Volunteers Sync Up - 26-November

## **Meeting Purpose**

To align volunteers on the new student log process, mid-year assessments, and upcoming crowdfunding campaign.

## **Key Takeaways**

- **New Student Log Process:** Volunteers must now complete a detailed student log form immediately after each class. This provides leaders with accurate, first-hand data on student progress and classroom dynamics.
- **Mid-Year Assessments (Dec 7):** English students will be assessed on Dec 7 to measure progress and determine potential level promotions (e.g., Word → Sentence). Maths students will have a "knowledge pit stop" test created by their teachers.
- **Crowdfunding Campaign:** An 8-week campaign starts in late Dec to fund next year's center operations. Volunteers can join the "coaches" squad to develop leadership skills.
- **Volunteer Engagement:** A Mumbai-wide WhatsApp group will be activated to foster community and networking among volunteers from all centers.

## **Topics**

### **New Student Log Process**

- **Why:** To get accurate, first-hand data on student progress and classroom dynamics directly from volunteers, who have the best insight.
- **When:** Immediately after class, during the debrief time (e.g., 5:30–6:00 PM). This is part of the volunteer commitment and not extra work.
- **What:** A separate form must be filled out for each student taught.
    - **Class Time:** 3:00 PM (15:00) to 5:30 PM (17:30).
    - **Program:** "Foundational Literacy" for English; "Tuitions" for Maths.
    - **Classroom Observations:** This is the most critical section.
        - **Content:** Must be highly descriptive and honest, covering student engagement, teaching practices, and any challenges.
        - **Rationale:** This data helps leaders identify solutions and support volunteers, not assign blame.

### **Mid-Year Assessments (Dec 7)**

- **English (Foundational Literacy):**
    - **Process:** Volunteers will use a standardized paper to assess students at their current level.
    - **Promotion Criteria:**
        - **Letter Level:** Score 10/10 to advance.
        - **All Other Levels:** Score 8/10 or higher to advance.
    - **Teacher Discretion:** Volunteers can decide to keep a student at their current level even with a high score, adding a comment to explain the rationale.
- **Maths (Tuitions):**
    - **Process:** Volunteers will create a "knowledge pit stop" test based on topics taught.
    - **Format:** No strict format or length; can be as short as 5 marks.
    - **Goal:** To check student understanding and progress.

### **Crowdfunding Campaign**

- **Goal:** Raise funds to cover center operations for the next year.
- **Timeline:** 8-week campaign starting in the last week of December.
- **Volunteer Roles:**
    - **Coaches:** A squad of volunteers will be recruited to lead the campaign, providing a leadership development opportunity.
    - **All Volunteers:** Will receive a Keto link to share.
- **CSR Leads:** Volunteers can earn reward money by providing leads to working professionals who can connect the organization with their company's CSR department.

### **Volunteer Engagement & Community**

- **Mumbai-Wide WhatsApp Group:**
    - **Action:** Dipak will share the link in the Vision Rescue group.
    - **Goal:** Foster community and networking among volunteers from all centers.
